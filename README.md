# Poseidon Cluster [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bsm/poseidon_cluster.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bsm/poseidon_cluster) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/bsm/poseidon_cluster/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/bsm/poseidon_cluster?branch=master)

Poseidon Cluster is a cluster extension of the excellent [Poseidon](http://github.com/bpot/poseidon) Ruby client for Kafka 0.8+. It implements the distribution concept of self-rebalancing *Consumer Groups* and supports the consumption of a single topic from multiple instances.

Consumer group instances share a common group name, and each message published to a topic is delivered to one instance within each subscribing consumer group. Consumer instances can be in separate processes or on separate machines.

## Usage

Launch a consumer group:

```ruby
require 'poseidon_cluster'

consumer = Poseidon::ConsumerGroup.new(
            "my-group",                               # Group name
            ["kafka1.host:9092", "kafka2.host:9092"], # Kafka brokers
            ["kafka1.host:2181", "kafka2.host:2181"], # Zookeepers hosts
            "my-topic")                               # Topic name

consumer.partitions # => [0, 1, 2, 3] - all partitions of 'my-topic'
consumer.claimed    # => [0, 1] - partitions this instance has claimed
```

Fetch a bulk of messages, auto-commit the offset:

```ruby
consumer.fetch do |partition, bulk|
  bulk.each do |m|
    puts "Fetched '#{m.value}' at #{m.offset} from #{partition}"
  end
end
```

Get the offset for a partition:

```ruby
consumer.offset(0) # => 320 - current offset from partition 0
```

Fetch more messages, commit manually:

```ruby
consumer.fetch commit: false do |partition, bulk|
  bulk.each do |m|
    puts "Fetched '#{m.value}' at #{m.offset} from #{partition}"
  end

  consumer.commit partition, bulk.last.offset+1 unless bulk.empty?
end
```

Initiate a fetch-loop, consume indefinitely:

```ruby
consumer.fetch_loop do |partition, bulk|
  bulk.each do |m|
    puts "Fetched '#{m.value}' at #{m.offset} from #{partition}"
  end
end
```

For more details and information, please see the [Poseidon::ConsumerGroup](http://rubydoc.info/github/bsm/poseidon_cluster/Poseidon/ConsumerGroup) documentation and the [Examples](https://github.com/bsm/poseidon_cluster/tree/master/examples).

## Running Tests

The test suite will automatically download, configure and run Kafka locally, you only need a JRE. Run the suite via:

```bash
bundle exec rake spec
```
